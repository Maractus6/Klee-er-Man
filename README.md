# H1 Goal of the Game
Goal of the game is to try to destroy as many brown blocks as you can before you run out of time. In order to destroy the block, you have to throw a bomb onto the blocks. You are given 1 minute to get as many blocks out as you can. You will be automatically teleported to the win screen after time runs out. You can't lose.
